# Green Hell Mod Menu

Green Hell is not cruel by accident.
It is precise. Patient. Unforgiving in silence.
The jungle watches, counts your mistakes, and waits for the smallest weakness.

**Green Hell Mod Menu** doesn’t tame the jungle.
It hands you a compass inside it.

## 🌿 Overview

Green Hell Mod Menu is a **persistent in-game overlay** that gives you direct, adjustable control over survival systems in real time. Unlike simple trainers, the menu stays with you — a quiet panel of sliders and toggles that lets you decide how intense, how realistic, or how forgiving the rainforest should be.

Some days you test yourself.
Other days, you study the jungle without fear.

Both are valid ways to survive.

## 🌘 Final Thoughts

Green Hell is not about comfort.
It’s about *understanding*.

This Mod Menu doesn’t silence the jungle — it lowers the noise just enough for you to hear its rules, its rhythms, its warnings.

Step carefully.
Adjust thoughtfully.
And let survival become a conversation, not a sentence.
